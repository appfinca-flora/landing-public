    <h2>Tree Planting</h2>
    <ul class="no-dec">
      <li>
        <h3>Q: I keep growing Oaks. How to plant different types of trees?</h3>
        <p>Tap on the <kbd>Seed</kbd> icon in the main screen before pressing the <kbd>Start</kbd> button, then you can take the Grand Tour and choose different types of trees to unlock at different stops. Enjoy!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Can I plant a tree while staying offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes. To plant a tree offline, please disconnect from Internet <em>before</em> pressing the Start button. Note that if you go offline <em>after</em> starting planting, your room will remain online (meaning that other people can still join the room) and you have to connect to Internet in the last minute for the app to determine the result correctly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Can I get notified when my tree grows up?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Lock your phone, then you will receive a notification when your tree grows up. Please make sure you have enabled <kbd>Notifications</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> to receive the notification. Note that you will not receive the notification if you keep your phone on.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Can I use other tooling apps (e.g., a dictionary) without killing a tree?</h3>
        <p>Yes. When planting a tree, you can take a break to use other apps by pressing the <kbd>Break</kbd> button. Once done, press the <kbd>Resume</kbd> button to continue the planting. The break time will be subtracted from your final focus time. Note that this feature is available only when there is no Price associated to the tree.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Can I turn off the break feature?</h3>
        <p>Yes. In the main screen, set a non-zero <kbd>Price</kbd> before pressing the <kbd>Start</kbd> button. Then the break feature will be disabled during the planting session. To know how the Price feature works, please tap on the <kbd>?</kbd> icon around the Price dropdown in the main screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: How to plant a tree with my friends?</h3>
        <p>There two ways to joint planting, by either hosting or joining a room. To host a room, tap on the <kbd>+</kbd> sign in the main screen and you will see a passcode for your next planting. Share the passcode to your friends, then they will be able to join your room after you press the <kbd>Start</kbd> button in the main screen. To join other's room, obtain a passcode from your friend, open the side menu by pressing the button at the upper-left corner in the main screen, choose the <kbd>Join via Passcode</kbd> option in the side menu, then you can join your friend's room by entering the passcode. Note that the host and guests in the same room can plant different trees by tapping on the <kbd>Seed</kbd> icon before pressing the <kbd>Start</kbd> and <kbd>Join</kbd> buttons, respectively.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Garden, Stats, and Stories</h2>
    <ul class="no-dec">
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Why do trees in my Garden disappear?</h3>
        <p>Each tree in your Garden lasts for 7 days. The purpose of such design, which mimics a garden in the real world, is to encourage people to stay focused on their goals <em>regularly</em>. In the near future, we will roll out a new feature that periodically takes the screenshots of your Garden so you can track/share how you have been doing more easily.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Do you post stories on my Facebook wall automatically?</h3>
        <p>No. We do not post the stories created in the Flora app to your Facebook wall automatically. If you want to post or share a story on Facebook or other platforms, press the <kbd>Share</kbd> button at the bottom-left corner of the story.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: How to hide a story from my friends?</h3>
        <p>Tap on the <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow at the upper-right corner of the story, then you will be able to adjust the visibility of the story. If you choose the <kbd>Only Me</kbd> option, then you will be the only person who can see the story.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Misc.</h2>
    <ul class="no-dec">
      <li>
        <h3>Q: How much does Flora consume energy?</h3>
        <p>Flora uses sophisticated mechanisms to correctly detect weather you have left the app during a planting session. We kept the energy consumption in mind when designing the detection mechanisms. Based on our experimental results, the app does not consume more energy than a normal music player app.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Q: Why is Facebook necessary to log into Flora?</h3>
        <p>Flora helps you and friends stay focused by growing a tree together. We use Facebook to simplify the invitation process such that your friends can easily join your current planting. We collect only the necessary information about you in order to provide the service, including your: 1) Name, avatar, and other basic info. So, your friends know who is inviting; 2) Friend list. This allows your friends to find you on Flora and send invitations to you. We respect the privacy of our users and have a strict <a href="ttp://flora.appfinca.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>. The information is processed in the U.S. and protected by laws. Currently, we are actively working on other login methods via Google, Twitter, email, and phone number etc. Thanks for your understanding and patience.</p>
