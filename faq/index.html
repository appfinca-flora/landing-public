    <p>
      Here, we try to answer some frequently asked questions. If you cannot find the answer to your question, please feel free to contact us via the in-app feedback or email at <a href="mailto:support@flora.appfinca.com">support@flora.appfinca.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Tree Planting</h2>

    <h6>Q: I keep growing Oaks. How to plant different types of trees?</h6>
    <p>Tap on the <kbd>Seed</kbd> icon in the main screen before pressing the <kbd>Start</kbd> button, then you can take the Grand Tour and choose different types of trees to unlock at different stops. Have a nice trip!</p>

    <h6>Q: Can I plant a tree while staying offline?</h6>
    <p>Yes. To plant a tree offline, please disconnect from Internet <em>before</em> pressing the Start button. Note that if you go offline <em>after</em> start, your room will remain online (meaning that other people can still join the room) and you have to connect to Internet in the last minute to help the app  determine the result correctly.</p>

    <h6>Q: How to get notified when my tree grows up?</h6>
    <p>Just lock your phone, then you will receive a notification when your tree grows up. Please make sure you have enabled <kbd>Notifications</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> to receive the notification. Note that, to prevent the app from being interruptive, we do not send you the notification if you keep your phone on.</p>

    <h6>Q: Can I use other tooling apps (e.g., a dictionary) without killing a tree?</h6>
    <p>Yes. During a planting session, you can take a break to use other tooling apps by pressing the <kbd>Break</kbd> button. You then press the <kbd>Resume</kbd> button when done. The break time will be subtracted from your final focus time. Note that the “break” feature is available only when there is no Price associated to the tree. To see how the Price feature works, please tap on the <kbd>?</kbd> icon around the Price dropdown in the main screen.</p>

    <h6>Q: Can I turn off the “break” feature?</h6>
    <p>Yes. Open the side menu by pressing the <kbd>Hamburger</kbd> button at the upper-left corner in the main screen, go to <kbd>Settings</kbd>, and then switch off the <kbd>Allow breaks while planting</kbd> toggle. Or you can set a non-zero <kbd>Price</kbd> when planting a tree, and the break feature will be automatically disabled during the planting session. To see how the Price feature works, please tap on the <kbd>?</kbd> icon around the Price dropdown in the main screen.</p>

    <h6>Q: When and why should I plant a tree with my friends?</h6>
    <p>You can plant a tree with friends or family when doing homework, studying, meeting, enjoying lunch/dinner, chatting, going sleep on time, etc. According to research [Festinger (1957), Heider (1946), and Newcomb (1953)], this will not only help you focus on the task at hand but also boost your productivity <em>in the long term</em>&mdash;once you make a commitment to people you care, your subconscious will keep your behavior in sync in the future. It also strengthens your friendship as the sense of accomplishing something together brings you closer. Just take a deep breath, go introduce the app to your best friends and plant a tree with them, then all of you will become 10x more productive for long ;)</p>

    <h6>Q: How to plant a tree with my friends?</h6>
    <p>There are 2 ways to joint planting, by either hosting or joining a room. To host a room, tap on the <kbd>+</kbd> button below the seed icon in the main screen and you will see a passcode for your next planting. Share the passcode to your friends, then they will be able to join your room after you press the <kbd>Start</kbd> button in the main screen. To join other's room, obtain a passcode from your friend, open the side menu by pressing the <kbd>Hamburger</kbd> button at the upper-left corner in the main screen, choose the <kbd>Join via Passcode</kbd> option in the side menu, then enter the passcode. Note that the host and guests in the same room can plant <em>different</em> trees by tapping on the <kbd>Seed</kbd> icon before pressing the <kbd>Start</kbd> and <kbd>Join</kbd> buttons, respectively.</p>

    <h2>Task Organization &amp; Planning</h2>

    <h6>Q: How to categorize my focus time?</h6>
    <p>During a planting session, you can tap on the <kbd>Tag</kbd> icon at the upper-left corner of the screen to categorize your intention. If you haven’t created any tag before, choose <kbd>Manage Tags...</kbd> then you will be able to create new tags. After planting, the Goals and statistics views at the left and right of the Garden view will be updated automatically, talking into account your tagging. Or you can tag your focus time after the tree grows up (or dies), by tapping on the <kbd>Tag</kbd> icon at the lower-left corner of the corresponding story.</p>

    <h6>Q: I forgot to plant a tree before staying focus. Is there a reminder?</h6>
    <p>Yes. During a planting session, tap on the <kbd>Tag</kbd> icon at the upper-left corner of the screen, choose <kbd>Manage Tags...</kbd>, then you will be able to create a reminder for any tag. You can choose when in a day and which day in a week you want to be reminded. Alternatively, you can set up reminders after planting a tree. To do so, swipe your Garden view to the right, identify the Goals view. Tap on the <kbd>+</kbd> icon or any bar you have created. Then you will see the Tags &amp; Goals view where reminders can be set. Happy planning your focus schedule!</p>

    <h2>Garden &amp; Stories</h2>

    <h6>Q: Why do trees in my Garden disappear?</h6>
    <p>Each tree in your Garden lasts for 7 days. So, you have to plant trees <em>regularly</em> to maintain a beautiful garden, just like how you maintain a garden in the real world :) On the other hand, Flora takes a snapshot of your Garden at the end of every week and you can see all the trees that you have grown by scrolling down your story list.</p>

    <h6>Q: Do you automatically post stories on my Facebook wall?</h6>
    <p>No. We do not post the stories created in the Flora app on your Facebook wall automatically. If you want to post or share a story on Facebook or other platforms, press the <kbd>Share</kbd> button at the bottom-left corner of the story.</p>

    <h6>Q: How to hide a story from my friends?</h6>
    <p>Tap on the <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow at the upper-right corner of the story, then you will be able to adjust the visibility of the story. Select the <kbd>Only Me</kbd> option, then you will be the only person who can see the story.</p>

    <h2>Real Trees &amp; Payments</h2>

    <h6>Q: Where and what types of real trees do you plant?</h6>
    <p>Currently, the real trees are planted in Africa and Southeast Asia. We support planting fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and tress that can provide forage and fuel-wood. More importantly, they all promote the long-term health of land and families in our rural communities.</p>

    <h6>Q: I got an error code during the payment process. What should I do?</h6>
    <p>Please email the error code to <a href="mailto:support@flora.appfinca.com">support@flora.appfinca.com</a> and describe the situation briefly. We will help you out there.</p>

    <h6>Q: Can I get a receipt for my payment?</h6>
    <p>Of course. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@flora.appfinca.com">support@flora.appfinca.com</a> including your account name and transaction ID found in the payment service (e.g., PayPal). Then we will send back your receipt for the transaction.</p>

    <!-- <h6>Q: How do I revoke my authorization of charges?</h6>
    <p>To delete consent for PayPal future payments for an app, log into your PayPal account profile at <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">https://www.paypal.com/</a> , and access My settings. For the Log In with PayPal setting, click Change and remove the mobile app from the list.</p> -->

    <h2>Misc.</h2>

    <h6>Q: How much does Flora consume energy?</h6>
    <p>Flora uses a sophisticated algorithm to correctly detect whether you have left the app during a planting session. So, it consumes more energy than a naive timer  app. However, we kept the energy consumption in mind when designing the detection mechanism. Based on our experimental results, the app does not consume more energy than a normal music player.</p>

    <h6>Q: Why is Facebook necessary to log into Flora?</h6>
    <p>Flora helps you and friends stay focused by growing a tree together. We use Facebook to simplify the invitation process such that your friends can easily join your current planting. We collect only the necessary information about you in order to provide the service, including your: 1) Name, avatar, and other basic info. So, your friends know who is inviting; 2) Friend list. This allows your friends to find you on Flora and send invitations to you. We respect the privacy of our users and have a strict <a href="ttp://flora.appfinca.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a>. The information is processed in the U.S. and protected by laws. Currently, we are actively working on other login methods via Google, Twitter, email, and phone number etc. Thanks for your understanding and patience.</p>

    <h6 id="flora-vs-forest">Q: Are Flora and Forest still partners?</h6>
    <p>Not anymore. As you might have known, we and the Forest developers are coming from the same lab in a university. In the lab, everyone agreed that the Forest and Flora apps will be focusing on single- and multi-user scenarios, respectively. At the time when the Flora app launched in Aug 2017, the two apps were initially designed to complement each other. However, after Flora gained some popularity, the Forest developers cloned the multi-user planting function in Feb 2018. Since then, the partnership between the two apps terminates, and the two apps start to evolve independently. If you enjoy planting trees with friends and our unique features like the Grand Tour, Garden, goal/habit tracker, “breaks” during a planting session, etc., please choose Flora!</p>
