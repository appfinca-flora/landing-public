The exclusive\n          means of resolving dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this\n          Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall\n          be Binding Arbitration administered by the American Arbitration\n          Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is\n          that you have the right to bring an individual claim against the\n          Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether\n          you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any\n          circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class\n          action, class arbitration, or other representative action or\n          proceeding.\n          {/*Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.*/}\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration\n          agreement. In doing so, you give up your right to go to court to\n          assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for\n          matters that may be taken to small-claims court). You also give up\n          your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding.\n          Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or\n          jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The\n          arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note\n          that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined\n          than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the\n          arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court\n          only for very limited reasons.\n          {/* For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.*/}{\" \"}\n          Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any\n          proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be\n          commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that\n          this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable,\n          any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court\n          actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located\n          in Sussex County, Delaware.
