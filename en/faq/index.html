There are two ways to use other apps while growing a tree:</p><ol><li><p>If you only need to use other apps occasionally, simply press the “Pause” button when growing a tree. Then you can go to any other apps without killing the tree. When done, go back to Flora and press the “Resume” button to continue the session.

To see how the Price feature works, please click on the “?” (question mark) icon next to the “Price” menu on the main screen.</p></li><li><p>If you constantly need certain apps for work, go to the “More” screen and switch the “Allow apps during Focus” option on. Then, you can select white-listed apps. During a focus session, you can leave the Flora app without killing the tree. But you cannot open the apps not in the whitelist.

So, keep working! During this phase, the focus duration will automatically count up to record the extra time you input. When done, you can press the “See Tree” button to end the session and see your tree.

After successfully growing a tree, press the “Timer” icon at the left of the “See Stories” button on the green focus screen, then you will be able to adjust the break timer. When the timer is up, a “Back to Work” notification will be sent to remind you to go back to work.</p></div></div><div class="Faq_qa__evn9Y mx-n3 mx-md-0 mb-3 svg-shadow" aria-controls="false-kill" aria-expanded="false"><p class="Faq_q__1qhzH">Q: I didn't leave Flora but my tree was still killed.

If verifying that it is indeed a false detection, we will revive your tree. If we find any bug that leads to a false kill, we will fix it ASAP. Meanwhile, you can take the following steps to minimize the chance of false detection:</p><ul><li><p>Do <em>not</em> press the home button before locking your phone during a focus session. Some people have this habit, but it kills the tree. Please leave the Flora app open.</p></li><li><p>Keep the version of your iOS and Flora app up to date.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you have a stable Internet connection. If you foresee connectivity issues, please grow a tree in the Offline Planting mode.</p></li><li><p>The iOS system may actively kill apps under some circumstances, such as when it faces memory pressure or when the phone is locked for a long time. If the Flora app is unfortunately killed by the iOS, your session will end. Flora will do its best to restore your focus session when it is opened again. However, please understand that we might not be able to always successfully recover your focus session due to iOS limitations. You can minimize the chance of an automatic shutdown by closing some memory-hungry apps (like games) in the background.</p></li></ul></div></div></section><section id="sec-group-planting"><h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Group Focus</h3><div class="Faq_qa__evn9Y mx-n3 mx-md-0 mb-3 svg-shadow" aria-controls="make-friends" aria-expanded="false"><p class="Faq_q__1qhzH">Q: How to make friends in Flora?</p><div class="Faq_a__3rPQ0 collapse" id="make-friends"><p>Share your QR code displayed on the “Friends” screen to your friends, or scan the QR codes shared by your friends.

Group focus sessions can also strengthen your relationships as the sense of accomplishing something together brings you closer.</p><p>Flora encourages joint tree planting by allowing each participant of a successful group focus session to win an <em>additional</em> tree grown by a random peer.

This setup gives you complete control over your Garden’s appearance. To enhance its beauty, consider these tips when deciding what to plant next:</p><ul><li>Avoid planting trees in succession. Since trees are spaced further apart, this can leave empty spaces in your Garden. Instead, intersperse them with flowers or fruit plants to create a denser, more vibrant look;</li><li>Try to mix plants with similar or complementary color tones for a harmonious aesthetic;</li><li>Designate certain plants to commemorate special events in your life.

All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.</p></div></div><div class="Faq_qa__evn9Y mx-n3 mx-md-0 mb-3 svg-shadow" aria-controls="data-in-cloud" aria-expanded="false"><p class="Faq_q__1qhzH">Q: Does Flora keep a copy of my data in the cloud?</p><div class="Faq_a__3rPQ0 collapse" id="data-in-cloud"><p>While most of your data (including the tour progress, garden, to-dos, and stories) are kept in the cloud, Flora currently does not store your “stats” on our servers. This means that <em>you will lose your stats if you re-install the app.</em> We will expand our servers to store everything in the future.</p></div></div><div class="Faq_qa__evn9Y mx-n3 mx-md-0 mb-3 svg-shadow" aria-controls="energy-consumption" aria-expanded="false"><p class="Faq_q__1qhzH">Q: How much energy does Flora consume?</p><div class="Faq_a__3rPQ0 collapse" id="energy-consumption"><p>Although Flora uses a sophisticated algorithm to correctly detect whether you have left the app open during a focus session, we kept the energy consumption in mind when designing the detection mechanism. Based on our experimental results, the app does not consume more energy than an average music-streaming app.</p></div></div><div class="Faq_qa__evn9Y mx-n3 mx-md-0 mb-3 svg-shadow" aria-controls="flora-paid-version" aria-expanded="false"><p class="Faq_q__1qhzH">Q: Is there a “paid version” of Flora?</p><div class="Faq_a__3rPQ0 collapse" id="flora-paid-version"><p>No. There is only one, free version of Flora. Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting. Any other apps that tried to clone this feature (and even charge it for money) are not associated with us. If you like planting trees with your friends and enjoy our unique features such as the Grand Tour, to-do list, and habit tracker, please choose the original Flora.</p></div></div></section><p class="mt-5 mb-4">If you have any other questions, please contact us via the in-app feedback system or email us at <a href="mailto:support@flora.appfinca.com">support@flora.appfinca.com</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script>!function(e){function t(t){for(var n,a,u=t[0],f=t[1],i=t[2],d=0,s=[];d<u.length;d++)a=u[d],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,a)&&o[a]&&s.push(o[a][0]),o[a]=0;for(n in f)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(f,n)&&(e[n]=f[n]);for(l&&l(t);s.length;)s.shift()();return c.push.apply(c,i||[]),r()}function r(){for(var e,t=0;t<c.length;t++){for(var r=c[t],n=!0,a=1;a<r.length;a++){var f=r[a];0!==o[f]&&(n=!1)}n&&(c.splice(t--,1),e=u(u.s=r[0]))}return e}var n={},a={2:0},o={2:0},c=[];function u(t){if(n[t])return n[t].exports;var r=n[t]={i:t,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[t].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,u),r.l=!0,r.exports}u.e=function(e){var t=[];a[e]?t.push(a[e]):0!==a[e]&&{4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:1,10:1,11:1,12:1,13:1,14:1,15:1,16:1,17:1}[e]&&t.push(a[e]=new Promise((function(t,r){for(var n="static/css/"+({}[e]||e)+"."+{0:"31d6cfe0",4:"4707e12a",5:"d572b08c",6:"a7c83c63",7:"891be337",8:"bd1fed3d",9:"09fd38fa",10:"e0578a87",11:"46d3d986",12:"996f9975",13:"a2f368bb",14:"edacad3e",15:"fa9678d2",16:"b7cada33",17:"517f2e82",18:"31d6cfe0",19:"31d6cfe0"}[e]+".chunk.css",o=u.p+n,c=document.getElementsByTagName("link"),f=0;f<c.length;f++){var i=(l=c[f]).getAttribute("data-href")||l.getAttribute("href");if("stylesheet"===l.rel&&(i===n||i===o))return t()}var d=document.getElementsByTagName("style");for(f=0;f<d.length;f++){var l;if((i=(l=d[f]).getAttribute("data-href"))===n||i===o)return t()}var s=document.createElement("link");s.rel="stylesheet",s.type="text/css",s.onload=t,s.onerror=function(t){var n=t&&t.target&&t.target.src||o,c=new Error("Loading CSS chunk "+e+" failed.\n("+n+")");c.code="CSS_CHUNK_LOAD_FAILED",c.request=n,delete a[e],s.parentNode.removeChild(s),r(c)},s.href=o,document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s)})).then((function(){a[e]=0})));var r=o[e];if(0!==r)if(r)t.push(r[2]);else{var n=new Promise((function(t,n){r=o[e]=[t,n]}));t.push(r[2]=n);var c,f=document.createElement("script");f.charset="utf-8",f.timeout=120,u.nc&&f.setAttribute("nonce",u.nc),f.src=function(e){return u.p+"static/js/"+({}[e]||e)+"."+{0:"7447ad52",4:"3610c76f",5:"9ebb6dc4",6:"e89d619d",7:"0df873a3",8:"aec705cd",9:"56709bde",10:"ad9ad7de",11:"b424d14f",12:"e1a74dc2",13:"30f81020",14:"120a425c",15:"827e772a",16:"ba4299a8",17:"6df6b18e",18:"ac746f86",19:"0feb4d7a"}[e]+".chunk.js"}(e);var i=new Error;c=function(t){f.onerror=f.onload=null,clearTimeout(d);var r=o[e];if(0!==r){if(r){var n=t&&("load"===t.type?"missing":t.type),a=t&&t.target&&t.target.src;i.message="Loading chunk "+e+" failed.\n("+n+": "+a+")",i.name="ChunkLoadError",i.type=n,i.request=a,r[1](i)}o[e]=void 0}};var d=setTimeout((function(){c({type:"timeout",target:f})}),12e4);f.onerror=f.onload=c,document.head.appendChild(f)}return Promise.all(t)},u.m=e,u.c=n,u.d=function(e,t,r){u.o(e,t)||Object.defineProperty(e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:r})},u.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},u.t=function(e,t){if(1&t&&(e=u(e)),8&t)return e;if(4&t&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var r=Object.create(null);if(u.r(r),Object.defineProperty(r,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&t&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)u.d(r,n,function(t){return e[t]}.bind(null,n));return r},u.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return u.d(t,"a",t),t},u.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)},u.p="/",u.oe=function(e){throw console.error(e),e};var f=this["webpackJsonpflora-landing"]=this["webpackJsonpflora-landing"]||[],i=f.push.bind(f);f.push=t,f=f.slice();for(var d=0;d<f.length;d++)t(f[d]);var l=i;r()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/3.b057a996.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.f682e434.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
