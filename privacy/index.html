Your continued use of Flora means you agree to this revised document, so please take a few minutes to read and understand it.</p><p>AppFinca Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects the privacy of its users (“you” or “your”). This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures when you use the Flora mobile application, website, or any associated software that we provide for you (collectively, the “Service”). Unless otherwise defined, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p><p>We encourage you to take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy and understand it. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you have any question about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p><h2>What Information We Collect about You</h2><p>We may collect information that can identify you ("Personal Information") and other information that does not identify you, as described below.</p><ul class="no-dec"><li><h3>Information You Provide</h3><p>When using our Service, you will be asked to provide information including, but not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, contact list. We will also ask you to authorize the access to your certain Facebook account information, such as your friend list. If you chat with other users of our Service, you provide us with the content of your chats. If you contact us, you provide us with the content of that communication, and if you transact business with us, you provide us with the related financial information.</p></li><li><h3>Log Data</h3><p>We collect information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit our Service (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, the type of mobile device and operating system you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, your location information, and other statistics.</p><p>In addition, we may use third-party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Service’s functionality. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.</p></li></ul><p>We collect this information through our website, mobile application, or third-party partners by using the following technologies:</p><ul class="no-dec"><li><h3>Cookies and Pixel Tags</h3><p>When you visit our Service, we may use cookies to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. A cookie is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser to help the site remember information about you and your preferences. We also may embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails to measure the popularity of our features and services. Pixel tags are invisible graphics used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed).</p></li><li><h3>Mobile Device IDs</h3><p>If you use the Service through our mobile applications, we use mobile device IDs (i.e., the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Data analytics companies also use device IDs to track information about the application usage.</p></li></ul><p>We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display ads on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies such as cookies (sometimes called DoubleClick cookies), web beacons, or mobile device IDs to collect information about users who view or interact with their ads.</p><h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2><p>We may use the information that we collect about you to</p><ul><li>provide and improve our products and services, and manage our business;</li><li>manage your account, provide you with customer support, and respond to your requests/inquiries;</li><li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others’ products, services, or content;</li><li>communicate with you by email, telephone, push notification, and/or other means about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;</li><li>develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and other sites, including providing our ads to you when you visit other sites;</li><li>website or mobile application analytics;</li><li>verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;</li><li>handle job applications;</li><li>enforce or exercise any rights in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>; and</li><li>perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li></ul><p>In all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your Personal Information only to perform services for us.</p><h2>With Whom We Share Your Information</h2><p>We will not share your Personal Information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your Personal Information shared. We may share your information with:</p><ul class="no-dec"><li><h3>Other Users of Our Service</h3><p>We may share your Personal Information with other users of our Service in order to provide the Service. For example, if your friends in the Service visit your profile page, they may see your name and some of your activities, and vice versa, to get value from the Service.</p></li><li><h3>Service Providers</h3><p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, and/or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

In such cases, we will provide notice before your Personal Information is transferred and/or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p></li></ul><p>We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers, and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes.</p><h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and you should not expect the absolute security of your Personal Information.</p><p>Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure channels such as email.

If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information for us, please note that we transfer the information, including Personal Information, to the United States and process it there.</p><p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.</p><h2>Your Choices About Collection and Use</h2><p>If you have a Flora account, you have the ability to review and update your Personal Information within the Service. You can delete the Content you have posted by either following the instructions in the Service or submitting requests via email to <a href="mailto:eraser@flora.appfinca.com">eraser@flora.appfinca.com</a>. Content you delete will be hidden or anonymized from other users. However, we may maintain a copy of such Content in our records. Please be aware that while information can be hidden or anonymized, it may not be possible to completely remove the information (such as when the Content is jointly created by multiple users) and that there still may be unwanted effects (such as when others had already seen the Content). So we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your Personal Information.</p><p>If you wish to back-up the whole or part of your Content, you will need to do so yourself. We do not undertake the obligation of backing-up user content.</p><p>You also have control over the collection and use of your Personal Information in the following areas of our Service:</p><ul class="no-dec"><li><h3>Push Notifications</h3><p>We may send push notifications or alerts to your device.
